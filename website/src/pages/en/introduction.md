**A simulation is only as good as its data**

Fake data is hugely valuable for local development and testing, but
how do we obtain it, and how do we keep it fresh?

ü§î **Fixtures**, or static snapshots of realistic records keep a
shared resource of fake data, but maintaining them is a tedious game
of whack-a-mole field and id updates.

üßê **Factories** partially alleviate this problem by automating the
generation of your fixtures. As your schema evolves, you can change a
single factory rather than patch a thousand individual records. But a
schema defines more than just the shape its records, just as
important, it also defines
the _relationships_ between those records, and factories don't help
you there.

ü§© **Graphgen** is a whole-meal solution for creating complete
datasets that contain not only realistic records, but also realistic
_relationships_ between those records. Data generated by graphgen is
always valid, so for example, if an organization has many members,
then graphgen will always generate a realistic number of them.

## Getting started

Graphgen is available on both
[npmjs.org](https://npmjs.org/package/@frontside/graphgen) and
[deno.land/x](https://deno.land/x/graphgen), see the [installation
guide](installation) to get going.
